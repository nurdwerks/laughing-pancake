//! Null Move Pruning
//!
//! This is a stub for the null move pruning algorithm. This is a technique
//! used to reduce the search space by assuming that if a player can make a "null"
//! move (i.e., pass their turn) and still have a score that is high enough to
//! cause a beta cutoff, then the current position is likely very strong, and
//! a full search is unnecessary. This is a powerful pruning technique but can
//! fail in zugzwang positions.
